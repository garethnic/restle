RSS reader built with React and Electron

This will be my attempt at doing some more React work while trying to learn as much es6 as possible. Packaging it inside Electron is also something I've been wanting try out.

Open sourcing my learning experience might also lead to PR's or issues to things I'm not even aware of. 

**Why create another RSS reader?**

I tend to go through quite a few tech sites during the day and having a central point of browsing the articles just seems a bit more logical.

There are various RSS readers out already, but I'm a developer so why not make my own.

**PS - Pull requests are welcome**

####UPDATE

*18-07-2016*

Foundation of the components have been added. App renders all components correctly. Data is also being pulled correctly, xml feed's transformed to json.

The ability to store feed url's can also be done. Feed validation is rudimentary and needs to be looked at.

The **important** part will be to handle the differences among rss feeds as they don't follow the same format. There's quite possibly magic source to handle this, will have to do some research.

Things are looking good!
